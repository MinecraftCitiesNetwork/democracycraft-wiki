## History
### Early History
On November 20th, 2020, Oakridge was opened to the public. The town’s popularity grew quickly and on the 8th of January, 2021, Oakridge’s first expansion happened. The expansion consisted of rentable stalls, a police station, a pharmacy, and a pier.
One of Oakridge’s major changes happened on the 8th of April, 2021: All drugs were made legal. This brought waves of new players and business owners to Oakridge as now selling drugs did not require citizens to have a black market stall.
_Zab_’s leadership came to an end in June as he stepped down from his position as mayor. After _Zab_ stepped down, Oakridge had its first mayoral election which ended on the 25th of June, 2021. At the end of the election, the next mayor of Oakridge, 1950Minecrafter, was elected.

### Transition to Reveille
Like all towns, the transition to Reveille damaged the town’s activity. Oakridge was almost entirely rebuilt when being transferred to the new map and went through several major structure changes in the process.
Due to the large number of players leaving DC due to the transition, Oakridge had trouble getting help rebuilding the town. However, after much struggle, Oakridge was able to get pasted onto the new map.
