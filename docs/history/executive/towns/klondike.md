# Klondike

## Overview
Klondike is DemocracyCraft’s newest town and functions as Redmont’s mining town. The town follows a steampunk theme and drafted its constitution on November 16th, 2021. Klondike strives for a just, fair, and tranquil society as seen in the town’s constitution’s preamble.

Klondike’s main industries include industrial plots, mines, lodges and resorts, caves, and ice fishing. The town was modeled after the territory of Yukon in Canada, but slowly grew away from its touristy theme and now focuses more on steampunk builds.

Klondike comprises four (4) districts: Residential, commercial, industrial, and government. The town's commercial center is roughly based on the shops and businesses in Diagon Alley from the Harry Potter series.

Klondike is based off of the Canadian region of Yukon which is home to a city also named Klondike. Redmont’s Klondike was named after Canada’s Klondike, as seen in the [town’s application](https://www.democracycraft.net/threads/tylxr69-town-application.8949/).

## History

On September 12th, 2021, Tylxr69 (now Tylxrfied) submitted the town application for Klondike. After a little under a month (October 9th), then secretary of state xEndeavour accepted the application thus officially marking the creation of the town. Klondike’s opening day took place on November 26th, hosting an ice boat racing competition, a snowball fight, and snowball easter egg hunt. After the festivities ended, Klondike’s rental regions were open to the public via auctions on the town’s discord server. The transition from Hamilton to Reveille marked several large changes in Klondike, notably a major theme change (cabins and ski resort theme to steampunk theme) and the removal of Klondike’s train. During the town’s third electoral term, then mayor SnoWhiteBeard stepped down from their position. Due to this, Tylxrfied stepped down from his role as deputy mayor and ascended to the position of mayor. However, Klondike’s constitution does not state that this is proper protocol, thus sparking a lawsuit titled [The_Donuticus vs. Town of Klondike](https://www.democracycraft.net/threads/the_donuticus-vs-town-of-klondike-2022-fcr-99.15510/) on December 16th, 2022.

## Geography

Klondike is located at the coordinates 3185 77 576 (Klondike’s town hall) and is surrounded by snowy mountains. Located in a taiga and warm ocean biome, Klondike’s grass grows a darker green.

### Industrial
Klondike’s industrial plots are mostly empty, however those that are filled are made almost entirely of brick. These large buildings are mostly empty and unowned.

### Commercial
Klondike’s commercial plots are pre-built and rentable, elaborately designed with many details. Most builds consist of spruce, birch, and warped wood along with bricks and sandstone.

### Goverment
Only three government plots exist, hosting Klondike’s hospital, city hall, and police station. All three buildings are located in the city center.

### Residential
Due to the transition from Hamilton to Reveille, Klondike currently does not have any residential plots. However, houses can be seen on top of mountains though they are unfinished and not for rent/sale.

## Economy
Klondike was the first city to introduce a public mine, in this case an amethyst mine (though it is currently not open to the public). Klondike also rents out drills to those with the need at a base price of $500 for one day. In addition to mining, Klondike also rents out 30 pre-built commercial buildings for $50 per 14 days. Klondike also has rentable stands and a rentable gas station.

| **168 Hours**                 | $3000                          |

## Culture
Klondike has several unique attractions. Klondike is the only town/city to have a gondola system as well as a heat converting tube near the top part of the gondola located at 3218 181 710. Klondike also boasts unique and complex copper and amethyst statues around the town, the most grand and largest being located in the town’s center. Klondike is mostly pre-built with a handful of exceptions but Klondike residents are very keen on keeping the steampunk theme throughout the town.

## Government
Klondike uses a council system; the first two councils had specific roles, such as Director of Industry or Director of Housing; however, starting at the town’s third council, these roles were dismissed and only the roles of mayor, deputy mayor, and councilor remain. As seen in the town’s constitution, Klondike’s government is also separated into two branches: legislative and executive. The executive branch consists of the mayor and deputy mayor while the legislative branch consists of the town’s councilors. Klondike’s mayor has the power to veto any bill that may come to pass within the town as well as fire and hire whoever they please for the council. In case of a mayor’s absence, the deputy mayor will gain the same powers as the mayor until they are back. While the roles of mayor and deputy mayor (or the executive branch in general) do not have a term limit, councilors have 60 day terms. When a mayoral election occurs, the player with the most votes will gain the position (this system also applies to the deputy mayor). Councilors will be elected in the same way, with the difference that the top 5 candidates with the most votes will get the job.
