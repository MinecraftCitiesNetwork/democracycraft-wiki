# Willow

## Overview
Willow, named after the tree of the same name, is Redmont’s farming town. Located North of Reveille at 1307 71 2039, Willow has become the number one place for citizens to farm. Willow was founded on [December 21, 2020](https://www.democracycraft.net/threads/vanquish_ap-town-application.2394/) by Vanquish27 (then Vanquish_ap).

The town follows a forestry and rustic theme, containing mainly medieval-esque builds. Willow builds mainly consist of dark oak and terracotta as well as many spruce and birch trees around the town.

Interestingly, Willow was originally going to be named Moondrop Valley. However, the farming town’s name was changed quickly after for unknown reasons. Willow contains roughly 40 farming plots for citizens to rent in order to cultivate animals or crops. Around 95% of all plots are rented on any given day.

### Population
Willow has a population of roughly **65** people (spawning residents). Additionally, 7 residential plots have been purchased or rented within Willow (on average).

## History
### Early Willow
Founded in December of 2020, Willow is an integrated part of Redmont. Vanquish27 became the first mayor of Willow and appointed _37__ as her deputy mayor. _37__ quit his position shortly after, and Westray became Willow’s deputy mayor.
Vanquish27 resigned from her position as mayor in late June of 2021. Westray took the position of mayor and named Tekkovvs as his deputy mayor. Under Westray’s control, Willow had dramatic reforms to its overall structure which included the rewriting of the town’s constitution.

### Transition to Reveille
Due to the controversy that was the Reveille transition, Westray, a prominent and popular player, left. Westray was Willow’s longest serving mayor. After Westray left, Mayor Twixted took over for approximately one month. However, not much progress was made in transferring Willow from the Hamilton map to the new map.
As of current, (1/23/22 at time of writing) commercial and residential plots have not been transferred, despite Willow being in Reveille for several months.

## Geography

### Landforms
Willow is full of spruce, birch, cherry blossom, and willow trees. The surrounding area is heavily forested and mountainous.


### Water Systems
Willow contains hardly any water, with its land to water ratio being 95% land. Even though Willow is located next to a beach area, it is not part of the town's land. Additionally, there are many small puddles and streams located in and around Willow, adding to its nature theme.

### Biomes and Resources
Willow, despite being on land, is largely in a warm ocean biome. This gives Willow its iconic deep green grass. Other, smaller parts of Willow are composed of the plains biome which cultivates the same vegetation.
Willow has an abundance of natural resources that include, but are not limited to birch, spruce, and cherry blossom (dark oak) trees as well as farming resources like wheat that plays a vital part in Willow’s economy.

## Economy
Willow’s economy mainly focuses around farming. As of current, Willow features 40 farming plots (f plots) that citizens of Redmont are able to rent. These are large plots which allow players to farm to their heart's content.
Willow provides Redmont with many farming related goods, including (but not limited to) wheat, carrots, potatoes, and beets.

### Culture
There are many prominent spots the eager tourist might want to take a look at, one being the horse statue in the heart of Willow. The statue is made of stone bricks, cobble, and smooth stone. It features a man riding a horse, holding Willow’s sunset flag.
Another key spot one might want to visit is the Willow clock tower. The Willow clock tower is a large clock made of spruce, basalt, and various stones. From the top of the clock tower, you can oversee much of Willow.

## Government
Willow’s government is separated into two branches: The executive and the legislative. Willow’s executive branch contains the mayor and deputy mayor. The legislative branch contains Willow’s town council, which, as seen in Willow’s [about me page/constitution](https://www.democracycraft.net/threads/about-willow.3176/), contains five advisors which serve four month terms.
If any changes are to be made to Willow’s constitution, it would require a unanimous vote by all five advisors.The transition to Reveille removed and transferred all industrial plots to [Klondike](https://wiki.democracycraft.net/history/executive/klondike), and thus no industrial plots are left in Willow. Nevertheless, Willow has kept its industrial advisor.

## Transportation
Willow currently does not have any public transportation. While you can access Willow through the airport menu, it will simply put you in the town square instead of in an airport like the other three towns.
