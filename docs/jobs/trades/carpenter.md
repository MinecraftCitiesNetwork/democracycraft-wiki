# Carpenter

The Carpenter is a great job for anyone enthusiastic about building furniture for people’s homes and businesses. Like many creating-centered jobs, Carpenters have exclusive recipes that only they can create. From chairs to plants to tables, Carpenters can create any piece to beautify people’s spaces.

## What Carpenters Do

Carpenters’ main job is to create and sell various furniture items that can make the buildings in the city and towns more appealing and realistic. Some items you can craft as a Carpenter are chairs, tables, paintings, trees, and more! Carpenters might collaborate with someone with an interior-designing eye to help advise and persuade clients to buy their furniture. They may also advise people on their own, offering their opinion on how the space would look best and how to decorate it.

In order to craft furniture recipes that include fabric, you will need to first build the Fabric Machine Plus.

It is recommended that you have a shop to sell your furniture in. This can be either a plot you buy and build yourself, or a space rented to sell your goods. People advertising plots for sale or for rent can be found in the Discord. You can also ask players in the server if they would like any furniture to spruce-up their environment.

You can also start your own Company on the server (separate guide available). You will need to take and pass the Entrepreneur Exam to earn your license. Then you can run an /ad on the server to spread the word about your business!

To gather resources to craft your furniture, you can either gather in the Wild or buy locally from players on the server. To access the Wild, use /warp airport, or  /find <item_name> in the server to see what players are selling and for what price!
